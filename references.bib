	doi = {10.1098/rstb.2015.0217},
	abstract = {There is no agreement among palaeobiologists or biologists as to whether, or to what extent, there are limits on diversification and species numbers. Here, we posit that part of the disagreement stems from: (i) the lack of explicit criteria for defining the relevant species pools, which may be defined phylogenetically, ecologically or geographically; (ii) assumptions that must be made when extrapolating from population-level logistic growth to macro-evolutionary diversification; and (iii) too much emphasis being placed on fixed carrying capacities, rather than taking into account the opportunities for increased species richness on evolutionary timescales, for example, owing to increased biologically available energy, increased habitat complexity and the ability of many clades to better extract resources from the environment, or to broaden their resource base. Thus, we argue that a more effective way of assessing the evidence for and against the ideas of bound versus unbound diversification is through appropriate definition of the relevant species pools, and through explicit modelling of diversity-dependent diversification with time-varying carrying capacities. Here, we show that time-varying carrying capacities, either increases or decreases, can be accommodated through changing intrinsic diversification rates (diversity-independent effects), or changing the effects of crowding (diversity-dependent effects).},

	abstract = {A major goal of island biogeography is to understand how island communities are assembled over time. However, we know little about the influence of variable area and ecological opportunity on island biotas over geological timescales. Islands have limited life spans, and it has been posited that insular diversity patterns should rise and fall with an island's ontogeny. The potential of phylogenies to inform us of island ontogenetic stage remains unclear, as we lack a phylogenetic framework that focuses on islands rather than clades. Here, we present a parsimonious island-centric model that integrates phylogeny and ontogeny into island biogeography and can incorporate a negative feedback of diversity on species origination. This framework allows us to generate predictions about species richness and phylogenies on islands of different ages. We find that peak richness lags behind peak island area, and that endemic species age increases with island age on volcanic islands. When diversity negatively affects rates of immigration and cladogenesis, our model predicts speciation slowdowns on old islands. Importantly, we find that branching times of
              in situ
              radiations can be informative of an island's ontogenetic stage. This novel framework provides a quantitative means of uncovering processes responsible for island biogeography patterns using phylogenies.},

	abstract = {The branching times of molecular phylogenies allow us to infer speciation and extinction dynamics even when fossils are absent. Troublingly, phylogenetic approaches usually return estimates of zero extinction, conflicting with fossil evidence. Phylogenies and fossils do agree, however, that there are often limits to diversity. Here, we present a general approach to evaluate the likelihood of a phylogeny under a model that accommodates diversity-dependence and extinction. We find, by likelihood maximization, that extinction is estimated most precisely if the rate of increase in the number of lineages in the phylogeny saturates towards the present or first decreases and then increases. We demonstrate the utility and limits of our approach by applying it to the phylogenies for two cases where a fossil record exists (Cetacea and Cenozoic macroperforate planktonic foraminifera) and to three radiations lacking fossil evidence (
              Dendroica
              ,
              Plethodon
              and
              Heliconius
              ). We propose that the diversity-dependence model with extinction be used as the standard model for macro-evolutionary dynamics because of its biological realism and flexibility.},

    abstract = { Identifying general patterns of colonization and radiation in island faunas is often hindered by past human-caused extinctions. The insular Caribbean is one of the only complex oceanic-type island systems colonized by land mammals, but has witnessed the globally highest level of mammalian extinction during the Holocene. Using ancient DNA analysis, we reconstruct the evolutionary history of one of the Caribbean's now-extinct major mammal groups, the insular radiation of oryzomyine rice rats. Despite the significant problems of recovering DNA from prehistoric tropical archaeological material, it was possible to identify two discrete Late Miocene colonizations of the main Lesser Antillean island chain from mainland South America by oryzomyine lineages that were only distantly related. A high level of phylogenetic diversification was observed within oryzomyines across the Lesser Antilles, even between allopatric populations on the same island bank. The timing of oryzomyine colonization is closely similar to the age of several other Caribbean vertebrate taxa, suggesting that geomorphological conditions during the Late Miocene facilitated broadly simultaneous overwater waif dispersal of many South American lineages to the Lesser Antilles. These data provide an important baseline by which to further develop the Caribbean as a unique workshop for studying island evolution. }

abstract = {Abstract Aim Accounting for geo-environmental dynamics is crucial to understand community assembly across islands. Whittaker et al. (J Biogeogr, 35:977–994, 2008)’s General Dynamic Model (GDM) aims towards this goal. Yet, it does not explicitly consider that most islands belong to archipelagos. We examined how island biodiversity dynamics are influenced by the interaction of eco-evolutionary processes acting at the archipelago level with each island's geo-environmental dynamics. Location Hypothetical archipelagos. Taxon Any. Methods We used an individual-based model, ecologically neutral within the archipelago. Several islands emerge in succession with a typical volcanic ontogeny. We considered both mainland and inter-island dispersal. Geographically isolated lineages diverged over time, possibly speciating. Results We found diversity to be at dynamic equilibrium. In an archipelago, islands hosted more diversity and more endemic species, at both island and archipelago levels, than an equivalently-sized single isolated island. This was due to an ‘archipelago effect’: inter-island dispersal increased within-island diversity through species occurrence on multiple islands; species may undergo anagenetic changes on the colonised islands, eventually speciating, thereby increasing archipelago diversity. Biodiversity dynamics of different islands may differ even on islands with identical geo-environmental dynamics because the archipelago effect varied over time and affected each island differently (‘history effect’). By accounting for these effects, we predicted detectable deviations from the GDM predictions, which are largest for remote archipelagos, with islands located close together and with an intermediate time of island emergence. In linear stepping-stone archipelagos, we predicted higher diversity on centrally located islands. Main conclusions Our results demonstrate that analyses of insular biodiversity data would greatly benefit from explicitly accounting for both archipelago and history effects. We suggest incorporating variables characterising the spatio-temporal structure of the whole archipelago. We discuss possible difficulties in distinguishing between the archipelago effect and equilibrium diversity dynamics.},

@article{reuter_role_2021,
    abstract = {As part of the Western Ghats-Sri Lanka biodiversity hotspot, Sri Lanka harbors a rich and diverse fauna with a considerable number of endemic species, especially in the wet southwestern part of the island. Understanding the origin of this biodiversity requires consideration of the land bridge history between the island and southern Peninsular India. To examine the influence of fluctuating sea levels and climate on island connectivity and isolation during the Miocene, we describe the lithological succession of the Jaffna Limestone in surface outcrops of north(west)ern Sri Lanka and interpret it with respect to palaeoenvironments and sequence stratigraphy. A stack of three marine intervals was identified, which were deposited in seagrass-, coral reef-, and nearshore siliciclastic environments of a land-attached carbonate platform and are separated by caliche and palaeokarst unconformities. They represent high sea-level peaks during the long-term sea-level maximum related to the Middle Miocene Climate Optimum (MMCO). In support of divergence time from Sri Lankan and south Indian species, it is argued that the Palk Isthmus connected Sri Lanka to mainland India prior the MMCO ($\sim$17–15 Ma) and after the Middle Miocene Climate Transition ($\sim$15–13 Ma), whereas a marine barrier continued to persist during low sea-level stands associated with the Mi2, Mi3a and Mi3 glaciations within this period of time. The early and middle Miocene landbridge connections opened up dispersal opportunities for terrestrial animals. Species migrations via the Palk Isthmus were, however, impacted by a climatic filter, which promoted a high level of ancient endemism on Sri Lanka. Our results indicate that the Sri Lankan sub-center of biodiversity started to evolve in response to increased sea-level and climate variability associated with Antarctic ice dynamics and the initiation of the South Asian monsoon system during the early stage of the current ice house period.},

	abstract = {While the theory of micro-evolution by natural selection assigns a crucial role to competition, its role in macroevolution is less clear. Phylogenetic evidence for a decelerating accumulation of lineages suggests a feedback of lineage diversity on diversification, i.e., ecological limits to diversification. However, does this feedback only occur between close relatives, or do distant relatives also influence their diversification? In other words: are there phylogenetic limits to these ecological limits? Islands form ideal systems to answer these questions, because their boundedness facilitates an overview of all potential competitors. The DAISIE (Dynamic Assembly of Island biota through Speciation Immigration and Extinction) framework allows for testing the presence of diversity-dependence on islands given phylogenetic data on colonization and branching times. The current inference models in DAISIE assume that this diversity-dependence only applies within a colonizing clade, which we term clade-specific (CS) diversity-dependence. Here we introduce a new DAISIE model that assumes that diversity-dependence applies to all species regardless of their ancestry, i.e. diversity-dependence applies both to species within the same clade and between different clades. We call this island-wide (IW) diversity-dependence. Here we present a method to compute a likelihood for this model and develop a statistical procedure based on likelihood ratio bootstrapping to compare it to the likelihood of the CS model in order to overcome biases known for standard model selection. We apply it to the diversification of \textit{Eleutherodactylus} frogs on Hispaniola. Across the Greater Antilles archipelago, this radiation shows repeated patterns of diversification in ecotypes which are similar across clades. This could be suggestive of overlapping niche space and hence between-clade interactions, i.e. IW diversity-dependence. But it could also be suggestive of only within-clade interactions, because between-clade interactions would have blocked the same ecotype re-appearing. We find that the CS model fits the data much better than the IW model, indicating that different colonizations, while resulting in similar ecotypes, are sufficiently distinct to avoid interacting strongly. We argue that non-overlapping distributions between clades (both spatially and in terms of ecotypes) cannot be used as evidence of CS diversity-dependence, because this pattern may be a consequence of IW diversity-dependence. By contrast, by using phylogenetic data rather than distributional data our method does allow for inferring the phylogenetic limits to ecological limits to diversification. We discuss how our new IW model advances our understanding also in other ways, ranging from identifying priority effects to modelling the spread of an epidemic in island-like systems, such as schools or hospitals.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
